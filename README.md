# go-dungeon

based on the solo gaming sheets from, [Perplexing Ruins](https://perplexingruins.itch.io/solo-gaming-sheets).

## Using

> \[...\] so pick a game system to run - i recommend something rules lite
> (Cairn, my game Ward, Bastards. are good choices) roll up 1-3 characters. roll up a home town and 
> put it in the center hex. then roll up a magical item "you need to retrieve" using the tables. 
> decided how many hexes away is the "objective" (roll 1d6 then 1d4 to determine direction and 
> distance) - travel to that hex, using the procedures described on the sheet. Enter a dungeon. use 
> the dungeon sheet to create the dungeon, in which you can find the quest item. return it to town. 
> Congrats solo adventure #1 complete (albeit very simple)
>
> HD for creatures = 1d6 each.
> 
> Keep it simple at first. treat it like an video game rpg, so after first quest done, include an 
> NPC to give you your next quest. This time, roll it up on the quest generator tables. then run 
> with it!
>
> hope this helps a little
